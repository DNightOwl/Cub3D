# Cub3D

## Introduction
The cub3D is a 42 School graphic design project inspired by the famous game Wolfenstein 3D. The project is a simple raycasting game engine, that includes several features like the implementation of the sprites and the ability to take a screenshot without running the game.
The project is using the [miniLibX](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/introduction.html) library.
